                        My name is Tim Lukens. I have always enjoyed computers and learning new things. I enjoy using Google very much. As soon as I have a problem I will use Google to discover a solution.
                        This has been a very useful skill for coding.

                        I have been self-teaching myself HTML, CSS, and some Javascript since January 2018. I had started getting into Node.js right before starting KU Coding Bootcamp. It was fascinating to me, and I really enjoyed it. I look forward to learning as much as possible in this new part of my life.
